# Project Proposal

## Project Title

Dukan Auto Tech - Export

### What?

Dukan Auto Tech Export application is a data management system designed for the global auto recycling industry. This system enables companies to keep track of their exported auto parts, manage their invoices, search for specific parts, understand key business metrics, list the parts to our Dukan trade mobile application, and much more.

### Why?

The global auto recycling industry is largely underserved in regards to technological innovations. More specifically the problem has been identified through my decade-long experience in this industry (My family business has been in this industry for the last 17 years). To test our assumption that the data management systems currently in place in the industry are inadequate for managers to manage their business, we launched a small MVP with five companies and we received valuable feedback. The main problem we are trying to solve with this solution is to give company manager's more business intelligence and oversight through one central system. This will enable these managers to make much more informed decisions when purchasing vehicles and enable them to accurately model future earnings. Another value proposition of this solution is that our application will be linked to another mobile application which will be used to advertise the companies' inventory to their potential customers.

### For whom?

Companies in the global auto recycling industry (quite a niche segment of the auto industry).

### How?

I have attached a copy of the documentation and interactive demo to display how we will achieve this.

### Scope

For a team of 4-6 developers over a semester-long, this project is definitely doable because the UX/UI, user flow, and application documentation has already been completed now the bulk of the project would be to develop it. We are also using a react.js theme which will significantly increase front-end development speed.
